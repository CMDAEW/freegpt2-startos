4. After entering the model tag (e.g., `tinyllama`), click the download button on the right. The software will automatically download the model.
5. To discover other compatible models and their tags, visit the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library). This page provides information about all the supported models. You can explore these models and choose the one that best suits your needs.
